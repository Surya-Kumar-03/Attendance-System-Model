        The Attendance Tracking System is a tool that uses the power of deep
        learning and machine learning to simplify the process of tracking
        attendance. This system is hands-free, meaning no more manual signatures
        or check-ins, and operates in real-time for maximum accuracy. With its
        user-friendly interface and automated features, the Attendance Tracking
        System streamlines the attendance tracking process, saving valuable time
        and resources for educational institutions.
